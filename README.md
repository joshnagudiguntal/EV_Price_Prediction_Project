## Week-1:--Choosing Dataset and Defining the problem Statement

This project focuses on predicting the price of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using *Machine Learning* techniques.  
It includes a dataset of 200 EV models with various features such as range, battery capacity, charging time, and more.  

The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates EV prices and helps understand the factors affecting an EV's range

## Problem Statement
Electric Vehicles are becoming increasingly popular,but their prices and performance vary based on several technical specifications

The Aim of this project is to:
-Predict the **price** of an Electric Vehicle based on its specifications

-Learn how to **forecast the range**(distance the Ev can travel on a full charge)

## 📂 Files Included  
- *ev_dataset.csv* — Dataset containing details of 200 Electric Vehicles.  
- *EV_Price_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb* — Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- *README.md* — Project overview and documentation.

## Concepts Learned
### 🔹 1️⃣ Machine Learning (to forecast EV range and price)
Machine Learning helps in predicting numerical values based on data.  
In this project, it is used for:
- *Forecasting EV range:* Predicting how far an EV can travel on one charge.  
- *Predicting EV price:* Estimating vehicle price based on battery capacity, power, brand, and efficiency.


### 🔹 2️⃣ Generative AI (for chatbot service)
Generative AI tools such as *OpenAI (ChatGPT), **Google Gemini, **DALL·E, and **DeepSeek* can be used to create a *chatbot service* that:
- Answers user questions about Electric Vehicles.  
- Provides insights or recommendations using the ML model results.  
- Can even generate EV-related images using tools like DALL·E.
